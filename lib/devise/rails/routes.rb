  class Mapper
    # Includes devise_for method for routes. This method is responsible to
    # generate all needed routes for devise, based on what modules you have
    # defined in your model.
    # Examples: Let's say you have an User model configured to use
    # authenticatable, confirmable and recoverable modules. After creating this
    # inside your routes:
    #
    #   devise_for :users
    #
    # this method is going to look inside your User model and create the
    # needed routes:
    #
    #  # Session routes for Authenticatable (default)
    #       new_user_session GET  /users/sign_in                    {:controller=>"sessions", :action=>"new"}
    #           user_session POST /users/sign_in                    {:controller=>"sessions", :action=>"create"}
    #   destroy_user_session GET  /users/sign_out                   {:controller=>"sessions", :action=>"destroy"}
    #
    #  # Password routes for Recoverable, if User model has :recoverable configured
    #      new_user_password GET  /users/password/new(.:format)     {:controller=>"passwords", :action=>"new"}
    #     edit_user_password GET  /users/password/edit(.:format)    {:controller=>"passwords", :action=>"edit"}
    #          user_password PUT  /users/password(.:format)         {:controller=>"passwords", :action=>"update"}
    #                        POST /users/password(.:format)         {:controller=>"passwords", :action=>"create"}
    #
    #  # Confirmation routes for Confirmable, if User model has :confirmable configured
    #  new_user_confirmation GET  /users/confirmation/new(.:format) {:controller=>"confirmations", :action=>"new"}
    #      user_confirmation GET  /users/confirmation(.:format)     {:controller=>"confirmations", :action=>"show"}
    #                        POST /users/confirmation(.:format)     {:controller=>"confirmations", :action=>"create"}
    #
    # You can configure your routes with some options:
    #
    #  * :class_name => setup a different class to be looked up by devise,
    #                   if it cannot be correctly find by the route name.
    #
    #    devise_for :users, :class_name => 'Account'
    #
    #  * :as => allows you to setup path name that will be used, as rails routes does.
    #           The following route configuration would setup your route as /accounts instead of /users:
    #
    #    devise_for :users, :as => 'accounts'
    #
    #  * :scope => setup the scope name. This is used as the instance variable name in controller,
    #              as the name in routes and the scope given to warden. Defaults to the singular of the given name:
    #
    #    devise_for :users, :scope => :account
    #
    #  * :path_names => configure different path names to overwrite defaults :sign_in, :sign_out, :sign_up,
    #                   :password, :confirmation, :unlock.
    #
    #    devise_for :users, :path_names => { :sign_in => 'login', :sign_out => 'logout', :password => 'secret', :confirmation => 'verification' }
    #
    #  * :path_prefix => the path prefix to be used in all routes.
    #
    #    devise_for :users, :path_prefix => "/:locale"
    #
    #  If you are using a dynamic prefix, like :locale above, you need to configure default_url_options in your ApplicationController
    #  class level, so Devise can pick it:
    #
    #    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    #      def self.default_url_options
    #        { :locale => I18n.locale }
    #      end
    #    end
    #
    #  * :controllers => the controller which should be used. All routes by default points to Devise controllers.
    #    However, if you want them to point to custom controller, you should do:
    #
    #    devise_for :users, :controllers => { :sessions => "users/sessions" }
    #
    #  * :skip => tell which modules you want to skip routes from being created:
    #
    #    devise_for :users, :skip => :authenticatable
    #
